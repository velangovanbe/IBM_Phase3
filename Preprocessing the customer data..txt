Preprocessing the customer data: 

Customer Perosnality Segmentation

Description:

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers.
 It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them
 to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target
 customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending
 money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can 
analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

The program generates a synthetic dataset and displays the first few rows of the dataset as shown above.
 The actual values will vary each time you run the program due to the randomness in data generation.
